		<h2>Group Members</h2>
		<p class="brief">1%	Form a group of 3 to 4 people. Include in your report the full names and student IDs of each member, together with a name for the group as a whole. Briefly describe each member’s strengths and weaknesses as relevant to this project. Your claims will be scrutinised by “intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic” who will not be impressed by boasting. Be particularly clear about how much you know about HTML5, the 'canvas' element, SVG, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

		<p>Our group (<strong>Toast Inc.</strong>) consists of the following 3 members:</p>

		<h3>Rory Mearns</h3>

		<p>I am a graduate of Victoria University of Wellington with a major in Geology. I am interested in becoming a web developer and am enrolled in the Diploma for Graduates at Otago University. I also have a background interest in graphic design.</p>

		<h4>Strengths:</h4> 
		<ul>
			<li>Although I have no experience with the SVG file format I have a lot of experience with static vector graphic formats (such as .ai & .eps). I also have some experience with the basic principals of graphic design including layouts, grids, composition, colour and typography.</li>
			<li>I have limited experience with using HTML & CSS and have spent some time learning Sass, a scripting language that extends CSS.</li>
			<li>I have experience in report writing and scientific documentation. I wrote a masters thesis at Victoria University and spent three years writing reports for an engineering firm. </li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Weaknesses:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>I currently have no experience with using Javascript however I came to Otago University with the goal of pursuing a career in web development and have a strong interest in learning Javascript as I realise that it is the bread and butter of the web industry.</li>
			<li>I have no experience with the SVG format of vector graphics.</li>
			<li>I currently have no experience using the HTML Canvas element.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section id="smartwatch_app">
		<h2>Section 2 (2%) - Our Smartwatch App</h2>
		<p class="brief">2%	Include a brief and clear description of the smart watch application you intend to prototype. Include a diagram showing how the work will be partitioned between the prototype proper and the emulator. Include storyboards if they are appropriate. Search for related products and say what you find. It is OK if someone else had your idea first.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="version_control">
		<h2>Section 3 (1%) - Version Control</h2>
		<p class="brief">1%	State which version control system you will use and why. Creating accounts on GitHub and SourceForge is easy and free, but you could set up a SubVersion, Mercurial, Git, Darcs, &c repository here or elsewhere. Include the URL of your repository in your report. This gets only 1% because it doesn’t really matter that much which version control system you use as long as you use some version control system.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="language">
		<h2>Section 4 (1%) - Programming Language</h2>
		<p class="brief">1%	State what programming language you will use. You may write in raw JavaScript, but you may also use a type checked variant that generates JavaScript, such as TypeScript or Dart. There is no wrong selection here, as far as marks go. The point is to make an informed choice.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="editors">
		<h2>Section 5 (1.5%) - Editors and IDEs</h2>
		<p class="brief">1·5%	State which editor you will use and why. You should look briefly at Eclipse, NetBeans, BlueFish, Brackets, and WebStorm. All of these except WebStorm are open source, and we have a licence for WebStorm. You should search on the web for comparisons of these programs; while we forbid plagiarism, research is good. The difference is honesty about who did what, giving credit where credit is due. You should include a short list of features that matter to you and why they matter.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="debugging">
		<h2>Section 6 (1.5%) - Debugging Tools</h2>
		<p class="brief">1·5%	Say what debugging tools you propose to use and why. Start with the W3Schools page on JavaScript debugging. You should particularly look at Chrome’s DevTools and Firebug, and of course check back with the IDEs to see what they offer in the way of debugging support.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="schedule">
		<h2>Section 7 (2%) - Work Schedule</h2>
		<p class="brief">2%	End with a section breaking the work to be done into pieces, estimating the pieces, and showing a timetable of who will do what when. You are not required to predict the future perfectly; these are estimates. Do not forget to include the time needed to learn to use your selected tools effectively enough.</p>
